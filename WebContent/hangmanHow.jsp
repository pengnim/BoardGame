		<p>
		One player thinks of a word or phrase; the others try to guess what it is one letter at a time.<br>
		The player draws a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word.<br>
		If a guessing player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the other player fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places.<br>
		If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the other player draws one element of a hangmanâ€™s gallows.<br> 
		As the game progresses, a segment of the gallows and of a victim is added for every suggested letter not in the word. <br>
		The number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is up to the players, but completing a character in a noose provides a minimum of six wrong answers until the game ends.<br>
		The first player to guess the correct answer thinks of the word for the next game.
